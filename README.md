## OpportunityCost.Life
Frontend for website [opportunitycost.life](https://opportunitycost.life). Takes a YouTube URL and calculates how much time has been wasted by everyone that has watched the video. Depends on a custom API implemented elsewhere.

Deploys the contents of the ```public``` folder to firebase when either the ```firebase deploy``` command is used, or code is pushed to the ```main``` branch using Github actions.
